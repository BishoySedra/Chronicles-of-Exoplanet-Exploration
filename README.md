## 🛠️ Features Breakdown

### 1. 🪐 Planet Personality Test (Exoplanet Classifier)

- **Purpose**: Engages students by matching their preferences to planetary traits, making the vast subject of exoplanet science more personal and relatable.

- **How it Works**: Users answer a series of questions. Based on their answers, an algorithm classifies them into different types of exoplanets, helping them explore and learn in a playful, interactive manner.

- **Outcome**: The user is presented with an exoplanet profile that showcases scientific data in a simplified, fun way.

### 2. 🤖 AI-Powered Chatbot

- **Purpose**: Helps students and educators explore exoplanet-related topics by answering their questions directly.

- **Technology**: The chatbot is powered by the Llama model, trained to provide information about exoplanets and link users to related NASA resources for further exploration.

- **How it Works**: Users can ask questions such as “How are exoplanets discovered?” or “What is the closest exoplanet to Earth?” The chatbot responds with accurate, concise answers and relevant NASA links.
